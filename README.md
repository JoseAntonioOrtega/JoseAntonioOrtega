- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoseAntonioOrtega, professor of Economics at the Universidad de Salamanca, Spain, Ph.D. in Demography, and academic editor at PLOS ONE.
- 👀 I’m interested in applications of R to econometrics, demography, sustainable development. I am a big fan of R. I carry out all my research and teaching activities using R.
- I am currently learning on the use of xaringan for presentations, the tidyverts for time series analysis, or the use of gamlss and VGAM to model demographic rates.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of common interest. I am also open for proposal of doctoral students in the PhD in Economics program at Salamance, <https://doctorado.usal.es/es/doctorado/econom%C3%ADa>
